# bbr
An open source tool to aid in command line driven generation of bug bounty reports based on user provided templates. Useful for piping reporting from one application to another (such as an automatic submission tool).

# Arguments
| Argument | Description                      |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| -h       | Display help message and exit   |
| -r       | Path to template file to use    |
| -t       | Variable to replace \_target\_ with and to use for `dig` and `whois` commands. |
| -u       | Username to replace \_username\_ with |
| -o       | Output file name. (optional)       |
| -p | Variable to replace \_program\_ (optional) |
| -re | Variable to replace \_researcher\_ (optional) |

BBR will then process the text file, and make the following replacements (not all fields may be present, some will be present more than once):

| Argument      | Description                                               |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| \_target\_      | Replace with the value of the -t argument                |
| \_username\_    | Replace with the value of the -u argument                |
| \_program\_      | Replace with the value of the -p argument                |
| \_researcher\_ | Replace with the value of the -re argument |
| \_sha\_         | Replace with the SHA256 encoded value of the -u argument |
| \_nameservers\_ | Replace with the output of "dig NS @8.8.8.8 _target_"     |
| \_dig\_         | Replace with the value of "dig @8.8.8.8 _target_"         |
| \_whois\_       | Replace with the whois output of the target parameter    |
| \_wayback\_ | Replace with an automatic wayback link of the -t argument |
| \_sha\_ | Replace with the SHA256 value of the username parameter |
| \_dig-txt\_ | Replace with the value of DNS TXT records |
| \_curl\_ | Replace with the request response of the -t argument |
| \_joke\_ | Replace with a joke |
| \_punchline\_ | Replace with the punchline for said joke |

# Functionality
BBR takes a provided template file and makes replacements throughout that file with provided arguments. For example, the following template file (stored in this repository as `template.txt`:

```
 # Summary
The domain _target_ was found to have a CNAME that was pointing to an unregistered domain.

It was possible to register this domain, and to host content on the _target_ website. Given this domain is attributed to _program_(see: attribution) I hosted only a SHA256 string of my researcher account, _researcher).

This can be verified by using the following in the terminal:

\```
echo "_username_" | sha256sum
\```
Which should present the resulting string:
\```
_sha_
\```
Which matches what I placed on _target_ for verification.

This has also been stored on the Wayback engine, in case this is resolved before this submission is able to be triaged: _wayback_

# Attribution
A whois of the domain _target_ shows a direct match to other domains relating to _program_, showing this as beloning to _program_:

\```
_whois_
\```

# Recommendation
Remove the CNAME associated with _target_, or decomission the domain entirely with a redirection to other domains of _program_. If you would like the domain I've claimed to be transferred to you, please don't hestitate to request it within this submission.

# Joke
Triage is a tough gig, here's a joke to lighten the load!

_joke_

... _punchline_
```

When used with the following:

```
➜  ./bbr -t example.com -p Example -u codingo -r ./template.txt | tee  
```
Outputs the following report:
```
 # Summary
The domain example.com was found to have a CNAME that was pointing to an unregistered domain.

It was possible to register this domain, and to host content on the example.com website. Given this domain is attributed to Example(see: attribution) I hosted only a SHA256 string of my researcher account, _researcher).

This can be verified by using the following in the terminal:

\```
echo "codingo" | sha256sum
\```
Which should present the resulting string:
\```

\```
Which matches what I placed on example.com for verification.

This has also been stored on the Wayback engine, in case this is resolved before this submission is able to be triaged: example.com

This can then be submitted to your platform of choice, and is a repeatable template as you find similar vulnerablities of the same type.
